# Sel â€“ Sed Lisp

[![License: MIT](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-MIT-yellow.svg)](https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT)

Have you ever wished you had a functional programming language, but all you had
was GNU coreutils?

Wish no more, with **Sed Lisp** a Lisp interpreter in `sed`.

## Quick start

```shell
$ make sel.sed
$ ./sel.sed <<EOF
val main (print "Hello, World!")
EOF
Hello, World!
```

## The language

### Example

```lisp
; Comments are ;

; Define values with val
val nil ()

; Write functions by quoting the function body, or with the func keyword
; The list function just returns its arguments
func list (args)
; ^^ syntactic sugar for val list (quote (args))

; usage: (foreach function list)
func foreach (
    (if (cadr-args) ; conditions are true if non-nil
        (nil
            ((car-args) (caadr-args))
            (foreach (car-args) (cdadr-args))
        )
        ; If the list is nil, do nothing
        nil
    )
)

val main (foreach print
    (list
        "a warm greeting"
        "from sed lisp"
    )
)
```
Run with:
```shell
$ make sel.sed
$ ./sel.sed example.sel
a warm greeting
from sed lisp
```

### Datatypes

There are four basic datatypes:
 - Cons cells
 - Strings
 - Builtins
 - Nil

### Evaluation

Everything is eagerly evaluated, unless it is quoted (`(quote (whatever))`).

In a list, each item is evaluated left-to-right, and then the head of the list
is run with the tail as its arguments.

Within a function, you can get the args using the `args` or `c[ad]+r-args`
builtins.

Sed Lisp also fully supports TCO.

### Builtin functions

There are an infinite number of builtin functions:

 - `quote`: returns its first argument without evaluating anything
 - `args`: gets the arguments to the function
 - `print`: outputs its first argument, a string
 - `if`: `(if cond a b)` does `b` if `cond` is `nil`, and `a` otherwise
 - `c[ad]+r`: standard Lisp `car`, `cdr`, `cadr`, etc, but with an unlimited
    number of `a`'s or `d`'s
 - `c[ad]+r-args`: `(car-args)` is equivalent to `(car (args))`, but faster and
    easier
 - `cons`: creates a new cons cell
 - `eq?`: returns truthy if the args are equal
 - `str-concat`: concatenates all of its arguments, which should be strings
 - `str-concatl`: concatenates a list of strings
 - `str-reverse-concat`: concatenates all of its arguments, which should be
    strings, in reverse order
 - `str-reverse-concatl`: concatenates a list of strings, in reverse order
 - `add`: add numbers (numbers are strings `[0-9]+`)
 - `dec`: decrement a number

### Dynamic symbol lookup and scope

There is no dynamic symbol lookup, and no scope.

Code is run in two steps:
 1. Parsing and name resolution. (File: `parser.sed`)

    The result is a collection of cons cells, strings, and builtins, with no
    names attached.

 2. Actually running it. (File: `runner.sed`)

### Mutability and memory management

Also none. Everything is fully immutable, and all data is leaked.

However, it's not as memory-inefficient as that makes it seem: everything
(strings, builtins, and even cons cells) is interned.

### Arithmentic

You can do arithmetic, too!  See and `fibonacci.sel` for an example.

It boasts AFAIK the fastest sed implementation of recursive fibonacci ever
written: (OK this used to be sarcastic but honestly it's gotten a lot better)

```shell
$ time ./sel.sed fibonacci.sel # Initial version
(fibonacci 10) is 55

real	3m10.428s
user	2m59.080s
sys	0m11.140s
$ time ./sel.sed fibonacci.sel # Improved version
(fibonacci 10) is 55

real	0m57.010s
user	0m55.048s
sys	0m1.915s
$ time ./sel.sed fibonacci.sel # Latest and greatest
(fibonacci 10) is 55

real	0m6.738s
user	0m6.675s
sys	0m0.054s
```

(The tail-recursive variant takes just ~~8.9 seconds~~ 300 milliseconds for the
same task.)

*Note:* Earlier benchmarks said 6 minutes.  That changed to 3 minutes since I
got a new computer.

## The implementation

It's MIT licensed, so you're free to use/modify/etc it. Not sure why you'd want
to, though.

Requires GNU sed. Tested with GNU sed 4.8.

It's also *blazing fast*.  The example program `test-prog.sel` performs multiple
list traversals in *under ~~a second~~ __half__ a second!*

```shell
$ time ./sel.sed test-prog.sel
sed lisp says: Check it out!
sed lisp says: Now with more recursion
sed lisp says: https://github.com/mb64/sel

real	0m0.204s
user	0m0.193s
sys	0m0.010s
```

It's in two parts, the parser and the runner.  They're designed such that they
can be run (and debugged) independently:

```shell
$ sed -E -f parser.sed input.sel > input.sec # sec for SEL Compiled
$ # OR
$ make input.sec
```

```shell
$ sed -nE -f read-all.sed -f runner.sed input.sec
```

See `notes.txt` for some design notes, and `continuations.md` for my explanation
of how the continuations work.
